## Introduction
I wanted to explore data science techniques on time series forecasting that would be helpful for businesses in areas like sales or demand forecast.

Since I love the concept of bike sharing as a mode of transport that is both good for the environment (no pollution) and also a good form of exercise, I decided to practice on a dataset of San Francisco bike sharing available from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share)

I define the daily demand of bike trips as the sum of all trips started at every station for each day.

## Approach
### This is the workflow I took:
