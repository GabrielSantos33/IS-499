## Introduction
I wanted to explore data science techniques on time series forecasting that would be helpful for businesses in areas like sales or demand forecast.

Since I love the concept of bike sharing as a mode of transport that is both good for the environment (no pollution) and also a good form of exercise, I decided to practice on a dataset of NYC.

## Approach
### This is the workflow I took:

Real-time Demand forecasting Analysis of CitiBike


Data source

Citibike historical data is available here https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data

Transform - Using Python, Jupyter notebook

Modeling

Linear Regression
Time series
Facebook Prophet
Evaluation - Forecast model and evaluate

Visualization - Using Tableau and Matplotlib
